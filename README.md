For our second individual project we had a total of 7 days to build a web application using Node.js and EJS.

## Built With

* **MongoDB**
* **Express**
* **Node.js**
* **EJS**
* **Mongoose**
* **Bulma**
* **Bcrypt**
* **Bluebird**

## The site

Flyer's Island is a site for aerialists in London which serves as a platform where users can register and view different classes and venues as well as be able to leave comments and compare prices. This was my first instance of working with Node.js backend and making a fully RESTful app. The app allows you to create a new user, login, add comments, classes, and venues alongside editing and deleting them.


## Blockers

* Working with EJS, back end and a database for the first time
* Learning that class is a reserved word in JS and therefore I needed to change my class names to it to klass.
* Learning to use Bulma. the layout of the content was not as I had hoped

## Wins
* I really wanted this to feel like a website someone would use to review these classes and based it off of a yoga website in terms of layout.

## More Time

If I had more time I certainly would have like to have implemented Google Static Maps to display the location.
